# Bazaar Blocklist
# Location: /etc/bazaar/blocklist.yaml
# 
# This file prevents Flatpak versions of system-installed applications
# from appearing in Bazaar's interface (search, browse, categories)
#
# Why? To prevent users from accidentally installing duplicate versions
# of apps that are already installed via dnf/rpm packages

blocked-apps:

  # Bazaar itself (now a system package, not Flatpak)
  - io.github.kolunmi.Bazaar

  # Gaming - Steam is installed via dnf
  - com.valvesoftware.Steam

  # Alternative browsers (if Firefox is your only browser)
  # - org.gnome.Epiphany
  # - com.google.Chrome
  # - org.chromium.Chromium
  # - com.microsoft.Edge
  # - com.brave.Browser

  # Old/deprecated GNOME apps
  - org.gnome.gedit                    # Old text editor (replaced by TextEditor)
  - org.gnome.Totem                    # Old video player
  - org.gnome.eog

  # Development tools
